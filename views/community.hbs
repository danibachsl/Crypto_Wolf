        <h5 class="card-title">Is Bitcoin about to rally to $110-120k ??</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Previously the $20k target was based around the idea of a wave 4 Elliot wave correction. A strong sell signal on the weekly. Now everything is in reverse. Wave 5 rally seems highly probable with a strong buy signal. Actually this is the first incredible buy signal I have seen on a weekly chart of Bitcoin , no matter the exchange.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Hello everyone, if you like the idea, do not forget to support with a like and follow.

Welcome to this ETH update.<br>

ETH is not looking good here. Forming a bearish pennant pattern in 1h time frame where breakdown of pennant is still pending. Once it breaks down from this pennant we can expect a dump.

        <p class="card-text">In one of our previous analysis, we showed a short setup from $23 with targets of $10. We achieved that target and made raw gains of over 50%! We blew past our short targets and now we are approaching the final legs of the bearish wave.</p>

        <p class="card-text">MOVRUSDT price has just tested the falling wedge upper trendline, this is a bullish pattern . So we are expecting Bulls will definitely react in this area and will try to break that resistance zone . If they succeed we could see a sharp upside move towards next resistance.</p>
